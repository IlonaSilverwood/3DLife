title: "Why 3D Life?"
---
I chose the name 3D Life as a reference to this [biopsychosocial model](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Biopsychosocial_Model), which in my experience applies just as much to sustainable training and nutrition practices as it does to chronic pain treatment.

My goal is to create a resource which encourages people to look at their health and fitness outcomes as the result of a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. Long term physical and mental well-being requires training and nutrition habits which are not only sustainable, but enhance our quality of life. A training or nutrition regimen which leaves you feeling progressively worse, physically or mentally, over the course of weeks or months needs to be reassessed and adjusted in order to avoid negative long term consequences.
