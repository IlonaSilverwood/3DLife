title: "Why 3D Life?"

My goal is to create a resource which encourages people to look at health and fitness as a multidimensional undertaking where biological, psychological, and social factors all impact our long term well-being and what we're able to achieve with our bodies. 

The 3 dimensions in the name refer to this [biopsychosocial model](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Biopsychosocial_Model), which in my experience applies just as much to sustainable training and nutrition practices as it does to chronic pain treatment.
