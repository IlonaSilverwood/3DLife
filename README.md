# Why is this guide being made?

There is too much incomplete or outright dangerous information about training and nutrition circulating in both online and real-life communities. The purpose of this guide is to make decision making and learning easier for those who are overwhelmed and uncertain about what they should be doing to reach their fitness goals.

# Who is writing it?

I am a [Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist](https://www.nsca.com/certification/cscs/) (CSCS) through the [National Strength and Conditioning Association](https://www.nsca.com/) (NSCA). I spend a lot of time helping people unlearn suboptimal to outright harmful training and eating habits, and hope that this resource will help both those already struggling as well as those who are just starting out and are unsure of where to turn for guidance. 

# How will this guide be published?

I will be using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) tools to create, publish, and maintain this project.
